# Student Performance Analysis System

## Project Description

The **Student Performance Analysis System** is a Python-based project that aims to analyze and predict student performance based on academic records and other factors such as attendance, extracurricular activities, and study hours. The system uses machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to provide insights into key factors that influence student performance.

---

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze student data based on academic performance, attendance, and other factors.
- **Prediction**: Predict students' future performance using machine learning models.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key insights using heatmaps and other data visualization techniques.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide suggestions for improving student performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (heatmaps, bar charts, etc.).
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (regression, classification).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and code execution.
